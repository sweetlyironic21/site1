As soon as you put quarks together in groups then the resultant particles are called Hadrons. …According to the standard model of particle physics, quarks come in six flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Three quarks can combine to form a particle called a baryon, and the most common baryons by far are protons--which contain two ups and a down--and neutrons--which contain two downs and an up.  In the present standard model, there are six "flavors" of quarks. They can successfully account for all known mesons and baryons (over 200). The most familiar baryons are the proton and neutron, which are each constructed from up and down quarks. Quarks are observed to occur only in combinations of two quarks (mesons), three quarks (baryons).3 февр. 2020 г. ...
