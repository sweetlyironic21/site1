The funny thing is, this as this is post stall maneuver. Extra drag is wanted. Ability is there, it can be used for a smart sharp turn or for an idiotic way to waste energy. Its up to the pilot. Actually V nozzles are far more useful in dogfight than the 2d nozzles on F-22. All aircraft achive those numerically superior maneuvers very close to ...There has been some speculation, but the mechanism behind the supermaneuverability of the Russian-built aircraft has not been publicly disclosed.
