An example of an interval timer.  Recording and alerting rules exist in a rule group. Rules within a group are run sequentially at a regular interval, with the same evaluation time. The names of recording rules must be valid metric names. The names of alerting rules must be valid label values. The syntax of a rule file is: groups: [ - &lt;rule_group&gt; ] Choosing an interval of 2 seconds will leave you with a much smoother outcome than using a 10-second interval. Here’s why: Let’s assume a red car passing your camera needs 20 seconds to drive through your field of view. An interval of 2 seconds gives you 10 images of the car passing, while an interval of 10 seconds leaves you with just 2. whole-interval recording a strategy for observing behavior that provides information about the specific timing and duration of the behavior. In whole-interval recording, the length of an observation session is identified (e.g., 1 hour) and then broken down into smaller, equal-length time periods (e.g., 10-minute intervals).  Interval recording systems present a desirable alternative to continuous measurement systems. They are frequently used in educational settings because they require less time and resources (Lane and Ledford 2014).However, because not every behavior event or duration is recorded, interval systems provide only an estimate of the …Recording the tangible outcome of a behavior rather than the behavior itself. Permanent products are important indicators of target behaviors that are not amenable to direct observation. What is Partial Interval Recording? Interval scales.
