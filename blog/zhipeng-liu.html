The probes were used for fluorescence imaging of hypoxic cells and real-time monitoring of ischemia in the liver and …The datasets of two Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (OMIP) simulation experiments from the LASG/IAP Climate Ocean Model, version 3 (LICOM3), forced by two different sets of atmospheric surface data, are described in this paper. The experiment forced by CORE-II (Co-ordinated Ocean–Ice Reference Experiments, Phase II) data (1948–2009) is called OMIP1, and that forced by JRA55-do (surface ...2007-09-01 to 2010-06-30 | Master (Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Life Science College)Zhipeng Liu; Wanqing Liu; Background and AimNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease.

Acknowledgments This research was supported by the Strategic Pilot Projects of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA26030103), the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 31722055 and 31672476 ), and the Key Science and Technology ...J-aggregation is an efficient strategy for the development of fluorescent imaging agents in the second near-infrared window. However, the design of the second near-infrared fluorescent J-aggregates is challenging due to the lack of suitable J-aggregation dyes. Herein, we report meso-[2.2]paracycloph …Ruixu Liu, Ren Ma, Xu Liu, Xiaoqing Zhou, Xin Wang, Tao Yin, Zhipeng Liu. PMID: 35776814 DOI: 10.1109/TUFFC.2022.3187748 Abstract Deep brain transcranial stimulation is used in both research and for the treatment of neuropsychological diseases. Ideally, such stimulation should be noninvasive and precisely controlled.  Shisheng Yuan, Maosheng Xia, Zhipeng Liu, Kaiwen Wang, Lijuan Xiang, Guoqing Huang, Junyu Zhang, Nan Li.
