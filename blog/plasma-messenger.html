Only you have access to your messages, and nobody else, including Plasma.Overview of cell signaling. Cells typically communicate using chemical signals. These chemical signals, which are proteins or other molecules produced by a sending cell, are often secreted from the cell and released into the extracellular space. There, they can float – like messages in a bottle – over to neighboring cells.In most cases, though, the answer is no—not by a long shot! For receptors located on the cell membrane, the signal must be passed on through other molecules in the cell, in a sort of cellular game of "telephone." The chains of molecules that relay signals inside a cell are known as intracellular signal transduction pathways. Plasma is a messenger that keeps your conversations secure.
