Build circuits with batteries, resistors, ideal and non-Ohmic light bulbs, fuses, and switches. Determine if everyday objects are conductors or insulators, and take measurements with an ammeter and voltmeter. View the circuit as a schematic diagram, or switch to a lifelike view.  The maximum battery voltage that the tester can handle is set by T5, and here it is 30 V. To ensure that T1 does not get too warm at high battery voltages, keep the test as short as possible. Use a push-button switch as a test switch so the battery being tested cannot be left under load by accident.
