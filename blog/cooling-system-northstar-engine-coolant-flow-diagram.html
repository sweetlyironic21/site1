Engine heat rejection to coolant Coolant flow at designed maximum engine operating RPM. You can also add coolant flow at peak engine torque as this can create challenges due to heat rejection versus coolant flow at lower engine speeds. Maximum ambient temperature the vehicle … · The surge tank is a low-flow part of the entire pressurized cooling system. You add/subtract enough 50/50 coolant/water mix to keep the level at the mid-seam line. Level checks and adjustments are done with the engine cold. As the engine warms up the coolant expands - a lot - and that expansion, working against the air volume in the tank, is ...   · Written by the Northstar System powertrain engineers. Northstars with failing head gasket(s) usually do not mix oil/coolant or vice versa. They simply overpressure the cooling system, blowing off coolant, overheating the engine due to no coolant flow.
