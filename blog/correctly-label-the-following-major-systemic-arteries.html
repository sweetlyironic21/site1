Vertebral artery normally arises from subclavian arteries of both sides of body.  The great vessels of the heart are major blood vessels that connect directly to your heart. These arteries and veins circulate blood between your heart and lungs, and between your heart and the rest of your body. The great vessels include your: Aorta. Main pulmonary artery (also called your pulmonary trunk).Match the atrial/ventricular pressure to the state of the valves. 1) Atrial pressure is greater than ventricular pressure - AV valves open. 2) Ventricular pressure rises above atrial pressure - AV valves closed. 3) Pressure in the ventricles is greater than the pressure in the great arteries - Semilunar valves open.Definitions A diagram of both pulmonary and systemic circulation. Pulmonary circulation is a part of the circulatory system responsible for forming a circuit of vessels that transport blood between the heart and the lungs.. Systemic circulation, on the other hand, forms a closed circuit between the heart and the rest of the body.It aids in transporting oxygenated blood, which carries nutrients ...  For example, if you start at the aorta of the heart, you will find three major arteries that branch from the top and supply blood to the head and arms. The first branch is the brachiocephalic, which splits into the common carotid and subclavian. The next artery attached to the aorta is the left common carotid, and then the left subclavian.Expert Answer. Transcribed image text: Correctly label the following major systemic veins.

Blood from right atrium enters right ventricle and pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood from right ventricle to lungs for oxygenation. Two pulmonary veins come from each lung and pass O 2 -rich blood to left atrium. Blood enters left ventricle from the left atrium.  Aortic Arch Branches. There are three major branches of the aortic arch: the brachiocephalic artery, the left common carotid artery, and the left subclavian (literally “under the clavicle”) artery. As you would expect based upon proximity to the heart, each of these vessels is classified as an elastic artery.Biology questions and answers.

The human heart is a four-chambered muscular organ, shaped and sized roughly like a man's closed fist with two-thirds of the mass to the left of midline. The heart is enclosed in a pericardial sac that is lined with the parietal layers of a serous membrane. The visceral layer of the serous membrane forms the epicardium.Arterial supply, anterior view. The arteries, in their distribution, communicate with one another (forming what are called anastomoses) and end in minute vessels, called arterioles, which in their turn open into a close-meshed network of microscopic vessels, termed capillaries, the true deliverers of oxygen and nutrients to the cells.
