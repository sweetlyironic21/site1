It says there were genera with global distributions and gives the example of Carolinites.Trilobites comprise a complex and huge class of arthropods with estimates of number of species ranging from 10 to 15 thousand among the nine distinct Orders. Despite their extensive fossil record, the extinct trilobites remain problematic in terms of both phylogeny within the trilobita, and trilobite placement within Phylum Arthropoda.Trilobites are marine creatures. This means that their main habitat is the water. They were found in deep seas, on the sea beds, in the open ocean, in shallow waters and rivers. They lived over 250 million years ago when the oceans were far more widespread than we know them today.

Nature 2023. About 465 million years ago, an armored critter resembling a sea roach died near what is now Prague.While studying their fossils, paleontologists noticed that many trilobite lineages evolved elaborate spines on their exoskeletons. At first, scientists hypothesized that these spines provided stability in the water — but further study suggested that most trilobites were too big for the spines to have been helpful in this way. That observation led to a second  Among the evolutionary trends of trilobites, gigantism yielded some spectacularly large species, expressed maximally in the orders Asaphida, Redlichiida, and Lichida.

And the fact that some trilobites attained prodigious sizes, often over a foot in length, suggests that molting behavior may well have continued throughout their lives.  Isotelus was a relatively large trilobite, common the late Ordovician seas. The basic body parts are easy to see on this specimen: the cephalon on the right, the thorax of eight segments in the middle, and the pygidium on the left. Whether scattered or whole, trilobite skeletal parts were hard enough to have a decent survival rate.Compared with trilobites, however, ostracods are generally rare and of low diversity throughout the Cambrian, except in some rocks of Australia and China.
