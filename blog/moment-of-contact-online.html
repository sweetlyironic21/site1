To determine the reactions at supports, follow these simple steps: 1. Sum of Moments (ΣM = 0) All we need to know about moments at this stage is that they are equal to the force multiplied by the distance from a point (i.e. the force x distance from a point).  The turning effect of a force about a pivot. The size of a moment is defined by the equation: M = F × d. Where: M = moment in newton metres (Nm) F = force in newtons (N) d = perpendicular distance of the force to the pivot in metres (m) The moment depends on the force and perpendicular distance to the pivot.
