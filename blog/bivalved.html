Cambrian bivalved arthropods are a group of arthropods characterized by their cephalothoracic bivalved carapaces. Many bivalved arthropods are known only from isolated carapaces, but fossils with soft tissue preservation are revealing an increasingly complex group, mostly comprising the stem-group euarthropod Isoxyidae (Aria and Caron, 2015) and the Hymenocarina. Ostracods consist of little more than a head. They have the typical five pairs of appendages on their head but only 1-3 pairs of appendages on the rest of the body. Their bivalved carapace may cause you to mistake them for tiny clams or mussels, thus the common name of "mussel shrimp". The two part, hinged carapace encloses the entire body ...bi•valve. n. 1. any mollusk, as the oyster or mussel, of the class Bivalvia, having hinged lateral shells, a soft body enclosed by a mantle, sheetlike gills, and often a retractile foot. 2. having two shells, usu. united by a hinge. 3. having two similar parts hinged together.Neurogenic bladder (NGB) with lower urinary tract dysfunction is found in patients with underlying neurologic diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s disease, traumatic spinal ...4. Visceral Mass. Another characteristic of mollusks is the presence of a visceral mass.
