Apr 7, 2013 · When the fan turns on the DOC temperature increases to almost 480F and as soon as the fan shuts off it goes back down to 440F. Obviously it's not reaching the 500F+ for the fuel to start dosing. No exhaust or boost leaks. Here are some of the data I wrote down during the parked regen: DPF DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE: 0.1hg  If regen is starting in the software (i mean it showing that regen is started and rpm goes up) and your doc inlet temp is not raising more than 380-480 then dosing will not start. Dosing starts after the doc inlet being heated up to 560+. This initial heating depends from turbocharger and intake throttle valve.  I have a Detroit dd13 that when I put it through a Regen, the temp spikes to over 1500 degrees and sets a code 3246/0. It also has EGR slow response code 3058/9.

AHI dosing will occur whether or not the AHI subtest is selected in order to meet target DOC outlet temperature (measured by the T2 temperature sensor) and SCR average temperatures and bring the NOx sensors online faster. Operation failure during Heating EATS phase:There is always something . Excessive idling does cause the DPF to need a regen more often. The Pete I was in, it was recommended that if we had to idle due to temps, that we raise the idle to 1500 to help keep the DPF hot enough to regen itself. However, with the other issues you said it has, sounds like it needs to see Mr. Peterbilt.This pdf document provides technical service bulletin (TSB) for diesel engine vehicles with 1-Box or Two-Box emissions package.

These temperatures are hot enough for igniting or melting common materials, and can also lead to serious personal injury. Even after the vehicle has stopped moving,  The ignition temperature of a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and the internal temperature-field distribution of the diesel particulate filter (DPF) during active regeneration are investigated during an engine bench test in this study. Based on the dropped to idle (DTI) test, a test method is developed to determine the safe regeneration temperature of the DPF. The results show that when the ...During active regeneration, the temperature of the exhaust gas must reach a certain level to burn off the particulate matter that has accumulated in the DPF. This temperature is typically around 600 to 700 degrees Celsius, or 1100 to 1300 Fahrenheit, which is much higher than the normal operating temperature of the engine. ...

Fuel is injected into the exhaust by the Hydrocarbon (HC) fuel dosing system. The injected fuel is oxidized in the DOC, which raises the temperatures above passive mode operating temperatures. After it stopped my truck requested another park regen. If you’re needing that many regens, you may need a new filter or perhaps a sensor. You should go see your truck manufacturer. I should add that 200° is normal temp for your dash to show. Mine goes up to about 225° before the fan kicks in and brings it back down to 200°.... DOC-boosted temp of 1100 deg. , we would have ... There WAS distinct mention of a "post" injection, which operated only during active regen,...Mack MP8 regen issues. 2012 CXU613 with 2012 fault codes so it's not a 2013. Truck arrived at the shop at the beginning of the week. Soot load was level 5. performed a parked regen. DOC inlet temp was bias. DPF outlet temp stayed above inlet temp during regen.The addition of engine exhaust to intake air increases the over- all heat capacity of the charge, leading to a reduction of peak combustion temperature. Since ...  Jun 19, 2016 · Fengjun Yan. Control of diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) outlet temperature is critical for downstream diesel particulate filter regeneration, but is challenging to control due to the non-minimum ... During vehicle operation, active regeneration is performed when the accumulated soot and ash reach boundary limits. In this operation, the particulate soot is ...COOLANT TEMPERATURE: 209F DOC INLET: 432F DPF INLET: 421F DPF OUTLET: 411F Last edited: Jun 10, 2017. 4vmach1, Jun 10, 2017. 4vmach1, Jun 10, 2017 #71 + Quote Reply.
