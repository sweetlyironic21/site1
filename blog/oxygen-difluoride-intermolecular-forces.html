Most notably, gases will generally decrease in solubility on increasing the temperature of the solvent, such as O2 and CO2 in water.Feb 9, 2022 ¬∑ Now, you need to know about 3 major types of intermolecular forces. These are: London dispersion forces (Van der Waals‚Äô forces) Permanent dipole-dipole forces. Hydrogen Bonding. Quick answer: The major ‚ÄúIMF‚Äù in hydrogen fluoride (HF) is hydrogen bonding (as hydrogen is bonded to fluorine). Since the molecule is polar, dipole-dipole forces ... a) beryllium difluoride or oxygen difluoride b) chloromethane or ethane. 5.
