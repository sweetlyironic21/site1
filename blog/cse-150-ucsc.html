For students with only one class left—look into part-time status and concurrent enrollment, as these can provided cheaper ways to finish off the degree. (Concurrent enrollment is not a good option for a class that fills up, as you usually won't be allowed in.)For some context I found CSE 100/L to be 3/5 difficulty &amp; 4.5/5 workload, CSE 120 3/5 difficulty &amp; 2/5 workload, and CSE 101 2.5/5 difficulty &amp; 3/5 workload. Bruh just don't. CSE 121 is a rough ride and I've heard that CSE 130 is notoriously difficult as well.
