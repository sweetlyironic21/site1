Two measurements are factored together to determine the Richter magnitude of an earthquake: the amplitude of the largest waves recorded on a seismogram of the earthquake, and the distance to the epicenter of the earthquake. The Richter scale (/ ˈ r ɪ k t ər /), also called the Richter magnitude scale, Richter's magnitude scale, and the Gutenberg–Richter scale, is a measure of the strength of earthquakes, developed by Charles Francis Richter and presented in his landmark 1935 paper, where he called it the "magnitude scale". The magnitude of an earthquake is measured by the Richter scale, using the formula R=log⁡(I/I_0 ), where I represents the actual intensity of the earthquake and I_0 represents a baseline intensity for comparison. If an earthquake’s intensity, I, is 1,000 times that of I_0, find its magnitude on the Richter scale. Explain your reasoning.An example power-law graph that demonstrates ranking of popularity.
