It's a top choice for everyone from law enforcement and military to professional security personnel and civilians. But what makes this round so popular?  Here's What You Need to Remember: A normal 9mm firearm will typically have a maximum chamber pressure of 35,000 pounds per square inch (psi). By using stronger, more powerful gunpowders +P ...So, no, bullet weight would not make a difference. Bullet weight won’t affect how fast a bullet falls vertically, but it can affect horizontal muzzle velocity and therefore affect how far each bullet will travel horizontally in the same amount of vertical drop time. 9 mm loads in 115, 124, and 147 gr often have different muzzle velocities.In general though a 9mm bullet travels at about 1200 feet per second.Of course that’s just the average. Some 9mm bullets can travel much faster and some much slower. It all depends on the specific gun and ammunition that you’re using.

You can find copper 9mm reloading bullets in weights 115, 124, and 147 grain. As for the lead bullets, you can commonly find that in 125-grain too. You can also use a 90 or 100-grain bullet tip, but you may have difficulty loading it into a 9mm case.This serves two purposes: it retains more energy while also slowing the bullet’s speed. That slower speed is the key to the effectiveness of subsonic ammo. If your bullet is traveling slower than the speed of sound (1,100fps), then it won’t break the sound barrier and produce the sonic crack associated with traditional gunfire.The speed of a 9mm bullet typically ranges from 1,153 to 1,427 feet per second (fps). concetta ...

Bullets from a 9mm handgun may max out at speeds as low as 102 miles per hour. And a . 30 caliber bullet, according to Mattoo’s equation, might do so at only 85 miles per hour.The .45 ACP is ideal for suppression because the projectile is already slow moving and generally maintains subsonic speeds. The 9mm is also a good candidate because it generally hovers just above the supersonic barrier in terms of velocity. With the right bullet and specialized loading, it can successfully be made subsonic. 300 Blackout …• The drag coefficient (CD) scales the drag at each speed based on the shape of the bullet. • The drag curve is just the drag coefficient for all speeds. • The drag curve of a bullet is determined by measuring its drag at multiple flight speeds; measure enough points at different speeds and connect the dots to make a drag curve.Now you're clued up on how many variables can impact how fast a bullet can travel, you can understand the standard range of speed that a 9mm bullet can travel in.
