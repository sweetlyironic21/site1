To see the entire chart or compare different gases, select Show All where appropriate. Refrigerant. Temperature. R22. R134a. R507. R410A. R404A.  The engine must get to its proper operational temperature of 80- 90°C/180-200°F. Now the LP and HP gauge readings need to be considered. To determine failures, the gauges’ indications must be referred to a table with R134a operating pressure values for HP and LP. Apr 30, 2019 · High 150 Low&gt;10. Expansive valve open or leak. Check valve or complete dye test. High 100 Low 100. Compressor does not engage. Check wiring. Note: The most ideal pressure readings are around 150 high and 30 low. Warning: Remember, venting 134a refrigerant into our atmosphere is illegal and bad for our environment. R-123 Refrigerant PT Chart. One of the very first steps when it comes to diagnosing your home air conditioner, refrigerator, or even your vehicle’s air conditioner is understanding the temperature and the current pressure that your system is operating at. Having these facts along with the saturation point, the subcool, and the superheat ...the increase of the discharge pressure. High discharge pressure The subcooled liquid will back up in the condenser and reduce the amount of surface area for the gas to cool. This will cause higher pressures. High condenser subcooling Because of the backed up liquid at the bottom of the condenser, this will cause the liquid to reachRefrigerants Number aChemical Namea Safety Group Global Warming Potential (GWP100b) Normal Boiling Point, °F (°C)a Unsaturated Organic Compounds 1130(E) trans-1,2-dichloroethene B2 N/Ac 117.9 (47.7) 1132a 1,1-difluoroethylene A2 N/Ac –122.5 (–86.7) 1132(E) trans-1,2-difluoroethene B2 N/Ac –62.5 (–52.5) 1224yd(Z) (Z)-1-chloro-2,3,3,3 …PROFESSIONAL R134a MANIFOLD GAUGE SET PART #89660 R134a TEMPERATURE PRESSURE CHART Ambient Temp (˚F) Low Side Gauge High Side Gauge 65˚ 25-35 psi 135-155 psi 70˚ 35-40 psi 145-160 psi 75˚ 35-45 psi 150-170 psi 80˚ 40-50 psi 175-210 psi 85˚ 45-55 psi 225-250 psi 90˚ 45-55 psi 250-270 psi 95˚ 50-55 psi 275-300 psi 100˚ 50-55 psi 315-325 psi The ideal pressure for R134A depends on the ambient temperature. For example, at an ambient temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit, the optimal low side pressure should be about 26 psi and the high side pressure should be about 225 psi. However, these numbers can vary depending on your specific vehicle model.One of the first refrigerants to go was our friend R-12. At this point in time, in the early 1990’s, R-12 had seen the majority of it’s usage in automobile air conditioning. R-12 was banned in new automobiles and was replaced with by the HFC refrigerant we all know today as R-134a. Now, there are still some R-12 applications out there today.What Pressure Should R404a Run at on a Cooler? What is R134a Replacement? Manitowoc Ice Training Resources for Technicians; How to Conduct Diagnostics on Delfield Specification Line; How to Replace a Delfield Specification Line Touchscreen; How to Change Danfoss ERC Controllers; R12 to R134a Conversion …However, the low-pressure gauges are unpredictable, which makes low-pressure diagnoses in the vehicle’s system troublesome. Therefore, it is important for you to tell the difference between low-pressure diagnostic procedures from the high-pressure ones. This guide is a fact sheet for people when handling the R134a AC system.101 Commercial Drive Mooresville, NC 28115. FJC is a manufacturer and worldwide distributor of quality automotive air conditioning parts and service accessories.Jul 4, 2017 · Static pressure is only partial indication and yes 50 psi=3.4 bars is low pressure. My cars would not start AC at all till I had 5 bars static. Anyway, here is the best DIY help for AC I know. If your climatronic can't read the sensors, you need to use scanner for it. Read the notes at the bottom. R-134A Refrigerant Pressure Temperature Chart - R-134A is an inert gas also known as Tetrafluoroethane, and for air conditioner systems.
