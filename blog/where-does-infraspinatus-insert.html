It is the largest of the rotator cuff muscles and its cross-sectional area is larger than the other three rotator cuff combined (infraspinatus, teres minor ...  Its insertion is on the humerus, specifically on the inferior facet on the posterior surface of the greater tubercle of the humerus (inferior facet on the posterior surface of the greater tubercle of the humerus (inferior to insertion of the infraspinatus). It has the same action as he infraspinatus muscle.One part of this muscle will insert into the round rough area above the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus. Again, another part of this muscle inserts into the medial aspect of the lateral tuberosity of the humerus bone. At the shoulder joint, the fleshy infraspinatus muscle becomes a thick tendon and crosses the caudal part of the major tubercle.The infraspinatus fascia is a tough sheet of connective tissue that covers the infraspinatus fossa of the scapula and the muscle within. Muscle ﬁbers originate from the fossa and fascia and then travel laterally to insert on the greater tubercle of the humerus. Frequently the infraspinatus fascia is quickly removed to appreciate the </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>
