Formally, the p-value is the probability that the test statistic will produce values at least as extreme as the value it produced for your sample. It is crucial to remember that this probability is calculated under the assumption that the null hypothesis H0 is true! More intuitively, p-value answers the question:• A number that can be expressed in the form p q, where p and q are integers and q ¹ 0, is called a rational number. • Lowest form of a rational number – A rational number p q is said to be in the lowest form or simplest form if p and q have no common factor other than 1 and q ¹ 0.

Similarly, when we describe an expression in words that includes a variable, we're describing an algebraic expression (an expression with a variable). For example, " 3 more than x ". can be written as the algebraic expression. x + 3 . Set builder notation is very useful for writing the domain and range of a function. In its simplest form, the domain is the set of all the values that go into a function. For Example: For the rational function, f(x) = 2/(x-1) the domain would be all real numbers, except 1.This is because the function f(x) would be undefined when x = 1.Divide the number of events by the number of possible outcomes. This will give us the probability of a single event occurring. In the case of rolling a 3 on a die, the number of events is 1 (there’s only a single 3 on each die), and the number of outcomes is 6. You can also express this relationship as 1 ÷ 6, 1/6, 0.166, or 16.6%.For a definition, Rational Numbers are those numbers that can be represented in the p/q form, where p and q are both integers and q can never be 0.
