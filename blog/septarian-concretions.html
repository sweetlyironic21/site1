If you don't see a match for the stone you've found here, you might find it here: Common Beach Stone ...Septarian nodules start out as concretions, which are basically solidified balls of mud. Concretions generally form around a nucleus of organic matter, such as a shell and are almost always found in sedimentary rocks that were deposited underwater. These concretions then become cracked through geological processes.The word 'concretion' is derived from the Latin concretio " (act of) compacting, condensing, congealing, uniting", itself from con meaning 'together' and crescere meaning "to grow". [2] Concretions form within layers of sedimentary strata that have already been deposited.The Moeraki boulders are large (to 2 m) calcite concretions with septarian veins of calcite and rare late-stage quartz and ferrous dolomite. The concretions are enclosed by Paleocene marine mudstones with vitrinite reflectance values of 0.29% R suggesting maximum burial temperatures of 25-30 degrees C. Microprobe analyses of these concretions indicate a Ca enrichment-Mg depletion trend with ... A concretion is a hard, compact mass formed by the precipitation of mineral cement within the spaces between particles, and is found in sedimentary rock or soil.

Geodes. Geodes, a type of concretion, are crystal-lined cavities in rocks. Jan 16, 2020 · Septarian Concretion. A septarian concretion is a type of concretion that contains angular cracks called "septaria." These cracks vary in shape, volume, and shrinkage. It is unclear what creates the septaria, but several mechanisms have been proposed, including the expansion of gases produced by decaying organic matter. Cannonball Concretion The process that created the septaria, which characterize septarian concretions, remains a mystery. A number of mechanisms, i.e. the dehydration of clay-rich, gel-rich, or organic-rich cores; shrinkage of the concretion's center; expansion of gases produced by the decay of organic matter; brittle fracturing or shrinkage of the concretion interior by either earthquakes or compaction; and others ...Carlile shale--Shale. chalky in lower part and containing thin chalk beds near the base, black fissile shale and large septarian concretions in upper part, fine-grained sandstone at top; marine.

Cannonball ConcretionSeptarian and non-septarian concretions have been found in the upper portion of the Blufftown Formation at several locations along a section of Hannahatchee Creek, in Stewart County, Georgia.Septarian Nodules. Septarian nodules are distinctly sphere-like concretions that are characterized by a series of cracks that widen towards the center and die out towards the sides of the concretion. These radiating cracks are often crossed by a series of concentric cracks giving them a "turtle-back" appearance.Offshore shelf sediments that were deposited in a dysaerobic environment are characterized by abundant framboidal pyrite and rare septarian concretions, composed of ‘early’ calcite and siderite. Intense sulphate reduction, promoted by the dysaerobic depositional water, was the primary influence on early diagenesis.Welcome to our Septarian Concretion page! Septarians were formed approximately 110 million years ago when the Gulf of Mexico reached what is now southern Utah. Decomposing sea (shell) life, killed by volcanic actions had a chemical attraction for the sediment around them, forming mud balls. Tide and wave action rolled the balls around ...These boulders are grey-colored septarian concretions, which have been exhumed from the mudstone enclosing them and concentrated on the beach by coastal erosion."

Classic paragenetic interpretations include initial …Septarian concretions (see Septarian Concretions) are precipitated carbonate nodules that also have fractures filled with coarse, multigeneration carbonate. Individual concretions can range from millimeters to several meters in length, and these sometimes coalesce to form larger sheets or irregular masses.Septarian concretions or septarian nodules, are concretions containing angular cavities or cracks, called “septaria”. The word comes from the Latin word septum; “partition”, and refers to the cracks/separations in this kind of rock.

The “fossilized turtle shell” pictured above is actually one of the more commonly misidentified pseudo-fossils in the rock record, a septarian concretion. Concretions aren’t the remains of animals or their shells at all: They are inorganic nodules that grow in rocks by precipitation from groundwater. Septarian is a grey limestone rock where the cracks and larger cavities were filled with calcite, barite, aragonite, and other minerals. Septarian is often referred to as “Dragon Stone” or a “Dragon Egg”, and are often called septarian nodules. Often there is crystallization in the larger cavities of the septarian rock creating a geode ...Septarian structures were initially formed as open fractures, and are most often concentrated in the central regions of concretions and reduce in width and frequency toward the outer parts of the concretion, which may or may not be cracked.Most concretions occur during deeper burial and many have distinctive internal features. ‘Septarian nodules’ have internal cracks filled with calcite, reflecting shrinkage during their development (Figure 12). Other concretions have complex nested conical fractures, termed ‘cone-in-cone structure’.  The septarian carbonate concretions from the Boom Clay (Belgium) consist mainly of authigenic minerals such as micrite (≤ 70% bulk volume) and pyrite framboids (∼ 3%). These mineral phases occur between detrital grains and fossils. The septarian cracks are lined with calcite, which is sometimes covered with pyrite. The preservation of delicate …Dec 15, 2018 · Silica-rich concretions with septarian-like cracks have been reported in the literature even if they are much less common and strictly related to particular settings such as: 1) Precambrian iron-rich formations affected by syneresis interpreted to be due to dewatering of silica gels (e.g. Gross, 1972), 2) continental environments where ...

Shaped and patterned similar to a tortoiseshell, naturalists in the past speculated that these oddities were dinosaur eggs and carvings by ancient humans. However, scientists have discovered that septarian concretions are mineral deposits that form around a ...  Concretions are hard bodies that form in sediments before they become sedimentary rocks. Slow chemical changes, perhaps related to microbial activity, cause …As a result, large volumes of early cements can form such as carbonate concretions of calcite, siderite, dolomite, or pyrite (e.g., Curtis et al., 1986; Hayes and Boles, 1993). High fluid flux can result in leaching of detrital aluminosilicate grains from the rock, leaving a residue of authigenic kaolinite (e.g., Hayes and Boles, 1992 ).The grey-coloured Moeraki Boulders have a slightly deceiving name.
