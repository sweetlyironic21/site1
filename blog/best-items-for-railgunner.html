Of course, this is assuming you have the shield up, so maybe not an upgrade for someone like Rex. 57-leaf clover also helps your chances of firing an Atg a lot, so clover+Atg is probably better than shrimp. And of course, simply picking up shrimp is an extra stack of the item. Not with syringes, that just increases your reload window and non-scoped shots, but are still good for the alternate primary.
