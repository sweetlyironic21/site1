Materials and methods: One hundred patients received continuous ACB alone (group A), and another 100 patients received continuous ACB and single …  The adductor canal block involves injection of local anaesthetic into the adductor canal deep to the sartorius muscle and is a technically easy and reliable method for blocking the saphenous nerve 1. This may be useful for post-operative analgesia after knee, foot or ankle surgery (usually in combination with a popliteal block). ...A continuous adductor canal block for total knee arthroplasty reduces opioid consumption compared with that of placebo in the first 48 hours after surgery. Other outcomes including quadriceps strength, distance ambulated, and pain scores all show benefit from an adductor canal catheter after total k …Best answers. 0. Aug 31, 2015. #3. The adductor canal is approach to the femoral nerve. The correct continuous code is 64448 (64447 for single injection). You can use 64448 for continuous infusion for the other, but, again, the fascia iliaca is the approach to the femoral nerve. The approach is through the iliopsoas muscle, through the fascia ...Adductor canal block (ACB) has gained popularity for postoperative pain control after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, its role in TKA has been questioned recently. Our study aimed to clarify the role of ACB in reducing postoperative pain after TKA and to elucidate an optimal timing to perform ACB for better outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive review of the perioperative records of ...They were randomized into three groups: Group S - control group received adductor canal block with 30 mL saline, Group R - ropivacaine group received adductor canal block with 30 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine and Group RC - clonidine group received adductor canal block with 30 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine with clonidine 1 μg.kg −1. The primary ...An adductor canal block (ACB) involves the injection of local anesthetic into the adductor canal to provide analgesia for surgeries of the knee, ankle, and foot. The human knee receives innervation by two groups of sensory nerves: an anterior group and a posterior group. A properly performed ACB anesthetizes the anterior group of sensory nerves ...CPT Code 64449, Introduction/Injection of Anesthetic Agent (Nerve Block), Diagnostic or Therapeutic Procedures on the Extracranial Nerves, Peripheral ...

J. Surg. , 31 ( 2016 ) , pp. 17 - 24 View PDF View article CrossRef View in Scopus Google ScholarThe Current Procedural Terminology (CPT ®) code 64447 as maintained by American Medical Association, is a medical procedural code under the range - Introduction/Injection of Anesthetic Agent (Nerve Block), Diagnostic or Therapeutic Procedures on the Somatic Nerves.The CPT code is 64450. Adductor Canal Block CPT Code The adductor canal block is a pain killer injection for pure sensory nerve block. This is injected after the knee surgery with a needle for post-treatment pain relief. The injection is administered to the specific site of nerve for greater effect. The CPT code is 64448.Adductor canal block (ACB) is a new technique that blocks the saphenous nerve and vastus medialis nerve under ultrasound guidance to achieve an analgesic effect. ACB has a similar analgesic effect to the previously common femoral nerve block (FNB) procedure. However, with the possibility of motor block, FNB will lead to instability of ...Pain relief following knee replacement surgery has typically been concentrated in the anteromedial aspects of the knee, with little relief for the posterior. Femoral nerve blocks cover the femoral nerve and adductor canal blocks cover the saphenous nerve. Blocking the sciatic nerve, which is what provides innervation to the posterior of the ...The adductor canal block (ACB) is a novel technique used for treatment of pain after knee surgery. There is nascent evidence that the ACB reduces pain and morphine consumption compared with placebo 1-4 and provides analgesia to a similar degree as the femoral nerve block. 5, 6 In contrast to the femoral nerve block, the ACB is predominately a sensory nerve block.  A nerve stimulator may be connected to a stimulating block needle to help identify the femoral nerve. The stimulator is set to a current density of 0.8 to 1 mA with a frequency of 2 Hz and a pulse duration of 0.1 milliseconds. The needle enters at an angle of 30 to 45 degrees to the skin in a cephalad direction.Ultrasound-guided adductor canal block - The ultrasound probe is placed perpendicular to the thigh at the midpoint between the anterior superior iliac spine and the base of the patella. The nerve is identified as it lies adjacent to the femoral artery. It is followed distally as it becomes more superficial, traveling with an arterial branch ...The Adductor Canal. The position of the saphenous nerve in the adductor canal has been well described, originally by Mansour 7 and later revisited by Hornet al. 8 Gray et al who published an earlier description of ultrasound guided sub-sartorial saphenous block 9. The adductor canal, also known as Hunter’s canal or the sub-sartorial canal, is ...CPT Codes As a general overview, physician services are coded using the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code system with or without modifiers (Table 1 and 2). CPT codes are assigned relative value units (RVUs), which account for three components: physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense.An 80 mm 22 gage Pajunk beveled tip needle was advanced into the adductor canal. After careful negative aspiration, 20 mL of plain bupivacaine 0.5% were injected into the adductor canal with intermittent aspiration. No blood was ever noted on aspiration. Visualization of some local anesthetic spread in the adductor canal was seen on ultrasound.For ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve blocks, use 64425; this code does not include imaging.
