The Paleozoic Era begins after the Pre-Cambrian about 297 million years ago and ends with the start of the Mesozoic period about 250 million years ago. Each major era on the Geologic Time Scale has been further broken down into periods that are defined by the type of life that evolved during that span of time. The Mesozoic Era is literally the era of “middle life.”. It is also known as the age of dinosaurs. It lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago and is divided into the three periods described in Figure below. The Mesozoic began with the supercontinent Pangaea. Then, during the era, Pangaea broke up and the continents drifted apart.Tertiary Period, former official interval of geologic time lasting from approximately 66 million to 2.6 million years ago. It is the traditional name for the first of two periods in the Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago to the present); the second is the Quaternary Period (2.6 million years ago to the present). <a href="google-wifi-app-download.html">It was a time of massive reorganization or “upgrading” of ecosystems, both on land and marine realms</a><a href="adt-security-app.html">Jenkyns in Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems v</a><a href="betsy-carlson.html">[9]1 / 11</a><a href="android-marketplace.html">By the beginning of the Cretaceous, the supercontinent Pangea was already rifting apart, and by the mid-Cretaceous, it had split into ..</a><a href="nicole-kidman-topless.html">Deutsch: Eine zeitliche Übersicht über das Mesozoikum, der ...The Mesozoic Era is divided into three time periods: the Triassic (251-199.6 million years ago), the Jurassic (199.6-145.5 million years ago), and the Cretaceous (145.5-65.5 million years ago).*The Cretaceous (IPA: / k r ɪ ˈ t eɪ ʃ ə s / krih-TAY-shəs) is a geological period that lasted from about 145 to 66 million years ago (Mya)</a><a href="citizens-voice-obituaries-wilkes-barre-pennsylvania.html">The first period of the era was called the Triassic Period</a><a href="orlando-google-maps.html">However, the end of the Devonian was marked by the predominance of a different life form, ..</a><a href="trylobite.html">The Cenozoic ..</a><a href="apk-downloader-from-play-store.html">The Paleozoic Era - green signposts; The Mesozoic Era - blue signposts; The Cenozoic Era - yellow signposts; Each Era is split into even smaller parts known as Periods and Epochs</a><a href="built-usa-reviews.html">Photo Credit: Wikimedia Commons</a><a href="nordictrack-rw500-review.html">abbreviation for the Cretaceous Period, and T is the abbreviation for the Tertiary Period</a><a href="weather-10-days-alexandria-va.html">The earliest geologic time scale had four intervals: Primary (first), Secondary (second), Tertiary (third), and Quaternary (fourth)</a><a href="atomic-habit-pdf.html">It is divided into three periods</a><a href="mis-videos-guardados.html">C</a><a href="xbox-one-upnp-not-successful.html">In the Early Cretaceous, Britain experienced a warm climate with lagoonal, lake and fluvial environments</a><a href="utep-mens-golf.html">C</a><a href="youtube-family-group.html">The first of the three periods of the Mesozoic is the Triassic Period</a><a href="gabby-from-love-after-lockup-instagram.html">A</a></p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>
