Superheat is checked by measuring the temperature of the vapor line, measuring the pressure, then subtracting the saturated temperature from the measured temperature. In the case of a …Most of you know R-32 as a necessary component in the widely popular HFC blend known as R-410A Puron. R-32 along with R-125 gets you that R-410A that is found in nearly every air conditioner today. However, in recent years there has been a push to slowly phase down R-410A. That is because of 410A's very high Global Warming Potential, or GWP.The heat pump will need to be recharged to restore the proper amount of refrigerant necessary for optimal performance.
