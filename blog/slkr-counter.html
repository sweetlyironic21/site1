JKR JKL ODB Bastila Hoda. Modding definitely matters (I don't remember the specifics) and …SWGOH Darth Malgus Counters. Based on 31,892 battles analyzed during GAC Season 44. Viewing the 99th percentile of occurances. You can click units to filter squads by that unit. Leaders are filtered separately. View the statistical breakdown of the top GAC Darth Malgus Counters on Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes!!  for the SLKR counter, JKR, JKL, Hoda, Bastilla, Old Ben if you're not doing the counter, you should use his lead. he can work with basically any Jedi, but the synergy with hoda and old ben is amazing. Use something like JKL, Hoda, OB, and then two jedi who can call assists. whoever you have is fine, because JKL does all the work.That is hard counter unfortunately. Maybe something with Dark Trooper and Range, but that TM train being held up pretty much leaves you without options. If you have a killer Vader, you may be able to Cull Hux after you do Moff Gideon's TM reset so Vader goes. You will need Piett too for the stacking offense and potency.My Jabba the Hut debut in Arena - 4 matches today vs Supreme Leader Kylo Ren, 3 wins and 1 loss.Me: Krrsantan, Leia, Skiff Guard Lando, Jabba the Hutt First ...Half of it is AI being dumb. AI will still target zombie for the most part even when JMK has high ground and the entire team can ignore taunt. You’re going to see them put a priority on Daka or even SLKR. Similar to AI always going after thrawn or gas.
