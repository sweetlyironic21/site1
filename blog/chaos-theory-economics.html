Chaos theory focuses on the unpredictability in occurrences and behaviors.  Whilst recognising that the future is unknowable, nonetheless, Chaos Theory allows for the possibility of an awareness of a range of future states. In addition, it suggests that complete and accurate information, so necessary for rational decision-making, is unobtainable, and the past is not an accurate guide to the future.  Chaos theory is the study of a particular type of systems that evolved from some initial conditions. A small perturbation in the initial setup of a chaotic system may lead to drastically different behavior, a concept popularly referred to as the butterfly effect from the idea that the actions of a butterfly may dramatically alter the physical state of the rest of the world.Abstract Traditionally, rational models of decision-making assume perfect information is available to the manager. In reality, the paradox of rationality is that full …Sep 3, 2007 · Chaos theory is a mathematical theory, and it is still in development. It enables the description of a series of phenomena from the field of dynamics, ie, that field of physics concerning the effect of forces on the motion of objects. The archetype of all theories of dynamics is that of Newton, concerning celestial motions. First published in 1994, this title was the best selling IEA publication of the 1990s.
