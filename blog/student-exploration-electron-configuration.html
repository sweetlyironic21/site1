By Kirsch , Uploaded: Feb 09, 2021. $10."The electron configuration of an element describes how electrons are distributed in its atomic orbitals. Electron configurations of atoms follow a standard notation in which all electron-containing atomic subshells (with the number of electrons they hold written in superscript) are placed in a sequence (BYJU'S, 2021)." Reference: We would like to show you a description here but the site won’t allow us.  What I said: The configuration of this family starts with 1 electron in 1s, and then the next down fills that row with 1 electron in the next. That means that each of them have 1 electron in the outer ring, which means they will react to other elements similarly, which is why they share a family. diagonal rule.
