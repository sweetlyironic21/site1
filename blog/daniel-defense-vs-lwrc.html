Going by the operating method, both the LWRC DI and POF renegade are direct impingement rather than piston. Both companies offer very good short stroke piston guns as well in both 5.56 and .308, but these are more standardized but high quality DI. The PWS is a long stroke piston.Yes. It'll work great. I've got a DD upper that I use on a LWRC lower, somehow the DD upper actually fits better than my original LWRC upper. Zero play between the DD upper / LWRC lower, a tiny amount between the LWRC lower / LWRC upper. Outstanding! Thanks for the reply. I am patiently awaiting its arrival.If I was in your position I would also consider a pof renegade plus. It has ambi controls like a lwrc but with a nice 3.5 single stage trigger and mlok.

Easily better even if they were all the same price. The fact the LWRC DI is still around $1000 +/- makes the LWRC DI the correct answer when deciding between LWRC , DD or BCM. BCM doesn't even make their own parts. LWRC makes well over 90% of their own parts in house.Length. When it comes to the lengths of both the rifles, there isn’t much to distinguish either. While LWRC comes with a length of 28 inches, POF is slightly larger and is about 34 inches long. Despite that, POF comes with a compact design that may not be suitable for many professionals.The only thing slightly tempting to me about the LT over the RISIII to me is adjustable gas for a higher back pressure suppressor, but DI systems can be tuned to be just as good, especially on longer gas systems.

I like the LWRC, but im not sure if the piston system will lower the accuracy. Anyone have any experience with either of these?Jun 23, 2016 · DD and LWRC are likely going to be similar, with the nod going to Daniel Defense for customer service and known quality in DI AR's. I personally like the aesthetics and ergos of the LWRC better, but little details like the goofy spiral fluting, proprietary rail attachments, etc. make the DD a more solid long-term setup, in my opinion.  With a 20″ 416R barrel, Magpul CTR stock that doesn’t wobble like other AR pattern stocks, and Magpul pistol grip, this rifles lends itself to accuracy. Stainless barrels reach out a bit better than standard 4150 CM barrels, and the improved drag coefficient on a .224 Valkyrie makes it stable in flight. The LWRC IC forged complete ambidextrous lower receiver is an excellent starting point for a hard-use rifle. The LWRC IC lower receiver offers ambidextrous controls to include: selector, magazine release and bolt catch and release.
