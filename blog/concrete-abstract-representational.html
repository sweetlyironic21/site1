These should not be done in isolation. They can work together in the same lesson to help kids build their deep understanding of fractions and what it means to operate with fractions. Concrete-Representational-Abstract Approach Concrete (Doing Stage). In the concrete stage, the teacher begins instruction by modeling each mathematical concept with concrete materials (e.g., red and yellow chips, cubes, base-ten blocks, pattern blocks, fraction bars, and geometric figures). Representational (Seeing Stage). In this stage, the ...Teaches conceptual understanding by connecting concrete understanding to abstract math process. By linking learning experiences from concrete-to-representational-to-abstract levels of understanding, the teacher provides a graduated framework for students to make meaningful connections. 3.

Abstract object theory is a discipline that studies the nature and role of abstract objects. It holds that properties can be related to objects in two ways: through exemplification and through encoding. Concrete objects exemplify their properties while abstract objects merely encode them. This approach is also known as the dual copula strategy.The first meeting involved modeling of the CRA methods at the concrete, representational, and abstract levels. The teacher took the manuals to review the instructional procedures. During the second meeting, the teacher demonstrated instruction at the concrete, representational, and abstract levels.WHAT IS THE CONCRETE REPRESENTATIONAL ABSTRACT MODEL? The CRA Model is an instructional approach for teaching math. It consists of three phases: Concrete; Representational; Abstract; In the concrete phase, we focus on using hands-on manipulatives. Students should be able to move and manipulate 3D objects to represent their thinking.Concrete Representational Abstract Sequence.

INTRODUCTION Algebra ...The main argument of my thesis is concerned with the representational and coding differences between abstract and concrete words and concepts. This difference will be analyzed from the viewpoints of distinct theories. In the literature, the fact that human beings process, understand and retrieve faster the concrete concepts in comparison with the …both concrete and abstract concepts representation is incomplete, since they are unable to solve the “symbol grounding problem” ( Harnad, 1990 ): to be understood and avoid circularity, symbolsWe would like to show you a description here but the site won’t allow us.The representation stage is when we start doing away with the manipulatives and we just have kids draw, just drawing a representation. And then the final stage is this abstract stage, where we’re just writing digits. This is also when we’re doing the algorithms, it’s seen as very abstract for kids. activities which use abstract repre-sentations of numbers, symbols and images. Many students, however, still need the benefit of concrete mate-rials and sensory motor experiences to enhance their understanding of the concepts associated with common fractions. Sowell (1989) and von Glasersfeld (2002) have argued for the continuing …Consistent with the predictive cognition literature, we suggest that the representational substrates of the mind are built as a hierarchy, ranging from the concrete to the abstract; however, we argue that there are qualitative differences between elements along this hierarchy, generating meaningful, often unacknowledged, diversity.  Abstract. Abstract. The abstract stage is the “symbolic” stage. Show how symbols provide a shorter, efficient way to represent numerical operations. During this stage, students move to using abstract symbols to model problems. Students need to understand how the abstract symbols relate to both the concrete and representational examples.2012/03/29 ... What is it?
