I only have morning glory seeds for reference, but I'd say the bodyload is less nauseous/sedating and more stimulating. Kind of like taking a big stretch and wiggling your toes. 20 mg is plenty for moderate visuals. I'd say above moderate really, but less than 15-20 mg isn't worth the trouble.  Microdosing LSD improves thought processing and increases learning capacity and motivation, etc., while microdosing a tryptamine (such as 4-HO-MET) may offer other benefits such as mindfulness in day-to-day life. Depending on the user, this may be better than microdosing with LSD. Also, 4-HO-MET is very euphoric in comparison to other ...4-Hydroxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine (also known as colour, methylcybin, metocin, and 4-HO-MET) is a lesser-known novel psychedelic substance of the tryptamine class. 4-HO-MET is structurally related to psilocin , the active ingredient in psilocybin mushrooms ( "magic mushrooms" ).  4-HO-MET-3,511 post karma 45,214 comment karma send a private message redditor for 4 years.

Shulgin has made the second part freely available ‚Ä¶4-ACO-DMT metabolizes into psilocin. 4-HO-MET is active on its own (or its unique metabolites are) Also worth mentioning that 4-ACO-MET is believed to metabolize into 4-HO-MET. Edit: I should also clarify further about my original comment. 4-ACO-DMT is probably considered an analogue of psilocybin rather than psilocin, since both 4-ACO ‚Ä¶Granted, 4-HO-MET is more potent per mg, but that's only because the 4-HO equivalent of 4-AcO-DMT is strictly illegal‚Ä¶4-AcO-MET has a similar potency to 4-AcO-DMT IMO. After all, in general, when it comes to the 4-X-tryptamine combos, the hydroxylated (HO) variants are more potent per unit mass than their Acetylated (AcO) counterparts (but qualitatively ‚Ä¶Substance: 4-HO-MET.

I was excited to try this compound because I had heard that it had very strong visuals and not much headspace. I don't entirely agree with the claim it lacks headspace, but I am very impressed with this chemical.My thoughts on 4-ho-met (metocin) I recently got this chemical, as my first psychedelic research chemical.

Reading on reddit and BL, there seemed to be many conflicting reports regarding dose. Some said 8/9mg would be very visual whilst others said that 15mg was threshold for them without any visuals. It seems many people respond differently to this chemical.96 votes, 54 comments. Out of all the psychedelics I've tried so far 4-HO-MET definitely has the best afterglow. It's been a week since the trip, and‚Ä¶I've tried lsd, 4-ho/aco-met, 4-aco-dmt and dxm (325mg). 4-ho-mipt is by far the most "hallucinogenic" out of all of them. Not only visual, but auditory. Everything starts warping and every particle of everything comes alive, music pitches down pretty frequently and sometimes sounds completely different. The auditory aspect of this drug can get ... Jul 16, 2017 ¬∑ 4-HO-MET is a tryptamine, the class of compounds that includes neurotransmitters (like dopamine and serotonin) and psychedelic drugs. It is also a functional analog of psilocin, one of the main mind-altering substances in psychedelic mushrooms (or ‚Äúshrooms.‚Äù) This means that it has similar effects as psilocin when ingested. 10mg of 4-HO-MET.Fumarate contains 21% fumaric acid by mass, or 2.1mg. Even assuming 100% conversion to maleic anhydride and that moisture in the respiratory tract does not hydrolyse it, that's really not much to worry about.The short story, ‚ÄúHow I Met My Husband‚Äù by Alice Munro is centered around themes of social class and memory/storytelling. The main character, Edie, actually has an advantage as a modest farm girl because she is able to see things more truth...4-HO-MET is great, and I'm looking forward to researching 4-ACO-DMT. I can say for certain that the Metocin experience is much lighter and easier than the mushroom experience. I wouldn't say I prefer either one, but after my last mushroom trip I haven't touched fungus for some time, and I don't think I could have an experience on Metocin that ...So I'd speculate that even if 4-HO-MET is further increasing extracellular serotonin, for most people on SSRIs, their serotonin receptors are just less sensitive to that serotonin. Also, it's worth noting that since SERT inhibition is a common mode of action between SSRIs and 4-HO-MET, they probably compete for binding at SERT, and so the net ...Wikipedia Page on 4-HO-MET.

In his book TiHKAL ( Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved ...I‚Äôve had 4-aco-dmt plenty of times and I‚Äôm just wondering what to expect from 4-pro-dmt in comparison to 4-aco-dmt. From the few reports I've seen it's pretty similar to 4-aco but may be more visually heavy. 4-pro is pretty new so there aren't too many trip reports. Edit: There was someone on here that was going to do a trip report but idk ...MET is more like a lighthearted DMT - it lasts 2-3x longer and isn't nearly as intense. MET is more visual than 4-HO-MET with a less intense headspace. I prefer MET over 4-HO-MET, but it's best when vaporized and you would want to convert it to freebase first. Snorting the fumarate salt works too, but I've heard it's painful.4-HO-MET is all-around fantastic. 4-AcO-DMT had more body load imo, but also gave better CEVs than 4-HO-MET. Insufflated is quite good, but an ethanol solution administered sublingually works about as well. aragorngw ‚Ä¢ 4 yr. ago. As another data point, the only body load I get on 4-AcO-DMT is pure pleasure. It makes me feel amazingly good.  Anyone see a grid that compares (trippier, more empathic, colors,etc) all the 4 series (aside from psychonautwiki). Curious how 4acodmt is differenet than 4homet and 4homipt. Can't speak to 4-HO-MiPT, but 4-HO-MET is in general less trippy and more "warm", visual and empathogen-like than 4-AcO-DMT or shrooms.4-ho-met is very visual and colorful with a mild headspace. Really a gentle fun psychedelic in my opinion. 4-aco-dmt is a very similar experience to eating mushrooms. It's supposedly a pro drug of psilocybin. 4-ho is my favorite recreational psychedelic that I've tried so far. Completely agree, for recreation it's beautiful ü§ó. 4-HO-MET Dosage. I'm a semi experience psychonaut. About 10 DMT breakthroughs, 4-5 acid trips, going up to about 400 ug, but most intense was 250 ug + weed and also a few shroom trips. I know it's hard to compare substances sometimes. I find 250 ug of acid to be a very solid dose. One thing I notice about 4-HO-MiPT it makes music feel like it touches your heart and inner being. It's a pretty deep pleasant almost intimate experience with music. 4-ACO-DMT makes me super alert but not energetic. It doesn't have a lot of warmth but it is very mental and visual. It's not mental in an emotional way but almost like mathematic way.hexachoron. Mr. ‚Ä¢ 3 yr. ago. No never tried 4-AcO-MET. fluffedpillows ‚Ä¢ 3 yr. ago. Although the risks are probably overblown and it most likely isn't that unsafe, you should freebase it first just to be on the safe side.
