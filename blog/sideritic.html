Total arsenic concentrations were determined for 73 ironstone derived soils and bioaccessible arsenic determined using an in vitro physiologically based extraction test. The bioaccessible arsenic ...  Alkali basalt, basaltic andesite, and dacite occur at the bottom of the sequence, covered by a thick suite of variously-colored, marsh–lake facies sediments, including medium- to fine-grained sandstones, siltstones, conglomerates, argillites and coal, with sideritic ironstone layers (Li, 1998, Wu et al., 2007c).The work presents some researches regarding to utilization in cement industry of the sideritic residue, stored in the ponds near from Hunedoara. Thus, on the chemical and granulometric compositions is obtained a number of 10 recipes of clinker, andmeasured core permeability show close agreement except in sideritic zones. The presence of siderit e causes a significant shift in the NMR T2 relaxation times and a subsequent decrease in NMR log permeability estimation. The shift to faster T2 relaxation time is primarily due to iron content in the siderite. NMR total porosity is unaffected byPathology. The reason why these nodules concentrate iron is uncertain, but it is attributed to differential iron metabolism in the nodule's cell population from differential transferrin expression 3.Stainable iron occurs in approximately 25% of all regenerative nodules 3.Of note, some prefer the term "iron-rich" nodule since the term "siderotic" may have a different meaning in pathology.The chemical data shows that the ironstones with composition largely reflecting the primary host rocks are of two types; the marine sideritic and fresh water sideritic ironstones (Akinlotan, 2019).
