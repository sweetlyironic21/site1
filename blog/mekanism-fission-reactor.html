Or put differently: The maximum burn rate is the number of Fission Fuel Assemblies in mb/tick. You can change the burn rate in the statistics tab. Default is 0.1. The smallest reactor has 1 Fuel Assembly, so it can run 10 times faster than by default. Mekanism V10 Fission Reactor Notes. I’m going to be updating this post with pictures and notes I have on the Mekanism V10 fission reactor and turbine system since it doesn’t appear to have a good written guide anywhere. The smallest reactor possible is 3x3 and 4 tall Image to be added. This reactor can be sustained using just a Turbine unit ... The fusion reactor will go as high as you can dump fuel into it. It does not have an overheat condition. You use coolant to extract more RF out of a particular burn rate. Fusion Reactors don't overheat, the hotter the better, but with water coolant you get stream which allows for even more power.Mekanism: Generators is a separate module for the main mod Mekanism. As its name suggest, this mod provides numerous ways to generate power. As of Mekanism V10, the following is a list of contents in the mod: Multiblocks: Fusion ReactorWell, you literally can't make a Fusion Reactor (or a bunch of the more late-game Mekanism stuff due to Polonium Pellets and Antimater) without first making a Fission Reactor.

To generate that much Steam, a Fission Reactor only needs to run at 552 mB/t burn rate (552 * 20,000 = 11,040,000). You need a second Turbine to take the excess steam (165 mB/t of burn rate) and so the second Turbine can be smaller. To run the max size Turbine at max flow rate with the Fission Reactor at 552 mB/t, my tests show that 9 coolant ...In today's episode of my One Billion Iron Ingot Challenge for modded Minecraft 1.16, I build a Fission Reactor and Turbine from the mod Mekanism. The goal of...Hi, I'm replicating a setup I used awhile ago in a earlier version of mekanism, a setup of the fission reactor and wind turbine that was designed by rage plays games. It should be a closed loop setup but my water coolant is depleting fast instead of ticking over even when set at 0.1mb/t rate limit.use the pump and infinite water block from pressure pipes. you will never be able to supply the reactor with enough water with their ratios otherwise. Unfortunately no pressure pipes on this pack : (. Magneticraft also has an infinite water source block; "Infinite Water" is what it's called. Some multiblock structures like Industrial Turbines, Thermoelectric Boilers and Fission Reactors have no actual send or receive rates. When piping them together, the only thing that really matters if the pipe network capacity vs. the heat rate of the reactor and boil rate of the boiler. Setting the pipes to pull mode would have no effect.To counter this and prevent a players base from being nuked if they mess up while building their reactor, some kind of Radiation protection block could be added, like "Atomic plating" which is made by first making steel plating (6 steel ingots that are laid out in lines of 3 in a rectangle that resembles the recipe for a sign) and infusing that with …Reactor &lt;-&gt; Turbine Setups almost always work with closed loop cooling setups (including Mekanism's if you set it up right).

The fuel consumption is probably higher, and the power output looks lower. If I Recall Correctly, the injection rate can be set to any even number between 0 and 98.It changes Mekanism's code at runtime. By creating a new recipe type and forcing the Fission Reactor to accept it, you can now add custom fission recipes to Mekanism. You just need to create the recipe like a datapack. Here's how the recipe JSON file should look like. Type: Always use "mekanism:fission" if you are adding a fission recipe. InputHelp with mekanism fission reactor. I made a fission reactor (17x17x18 turbine and 7x7x6 reactor) and everything seemed to be running smoothly; the temp was about 400K, and the coolant tank never dropped below the max amount of water. Then, for seemingly no reason, the reactor blew up. I was standing right next to the reactor and I had Quantum ...Extreme Reactors is easy to set up, so Its best for earlygame. however, it puts out enough power for mid and endgame too. Powah isn't worth it - too expensive for what mekanism also does. the mekanism fission and fusion reactors are best for endgame by far. they provide millions of RF per tick, and also give you valuable nuclear waste.  Xygen8 • 7 yr. ago. Nope, it can't even supply the reactor with enough water at an injection rate of 4 which is the minimum value required to keep an actively cooled reactor running. At that injection rate, it "only" produces 150k mB/t of steam. EDIT: I tried it with Ultimate Mechanical Pipes and noticed two things: Reactor &lt;-&gt; Turbine Setups almost always work with closed loop cooling setups (including Mekanism's if you set it up right).
