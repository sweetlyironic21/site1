But for MyNIC .my domains, to enable DNSSEC, the steps ...DNSSEC is a security protocol that validates DNS query results. It protects internet users (clients) from forged DNS data (resolvers.) It uses tamper-proof, digitally signed keys to verify the authenticity of online destinations. It's like a digital handshake that confirms two parties are who they claim to be.  Reverse DNS (rDNS) is a method of resolving an IP address into a domain name , just as the domain name system (DNS) resolves domain names into associated IP addresses. One of the applications of reverse DNS is as a spam filter . Here's how it works: Typically, a spammer uses an invalid IP address, one that doesn't match the domain name. A ...There were two more DNSSEC-related flags introduced in RFC 4035: CD (Checking Disabled): indicates a security-aware resolver should disable signature validation (that is, not check DNSSEC records) AD (Authentic Data): indicates the resolver believes the responses to be authentic - that is, validated by DNSSEC.

Oct 20, 2023 · DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) overview. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a feature of the Domain Name System (DNS) that authenticates responses to domain name lookups. It does not provide privacy protections for those lookups, but prevents attackers from manipulating or poisoning the responses to DNS requests. DNSSEC provides mechanisms by which a security-aware resolver can determine whether an RRset's signature is "valid" within the meaning of DNSSEC. In the final analysis, however, authenticating both DNS keys and data is a matter of local policy, which may extend or even override the protocol extensions defined in this document set.DNSSEC stands for Domain Name System Security Extensions. It's a security protocol that adds an extra layer of protection to the Domain Name System (DNS) — the contacts list of the internet.
