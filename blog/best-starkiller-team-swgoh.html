Starkiller's kit will reduce these cooldowns by 4 turns each every time he uses a special, in theory allowing Visas to use them far more often. Additionally, players have complained about the clause in her kit that requires she has no debuffs in order to gain 100% counter chance. Starkiller solves this problem, too.  How to counter GG w/ zBastila lead w/ JKRevan, Jolee, GM Yoda, Old Ben/Hermit: 1: use JKRevan’s MIDDLE ability to swap TM with GM Yoda. 2: do Yoda’s jump move to gain stealth, then his far right special to spread foresight. 3: B2 does his AOE which everyone dodges, then B2 loses stealth. 4: mark B2 with JKRevan.Old Ben and Hoda, as mentioned, fit great. Having a dispel on basic (JKL or Shaak) is handy. Once (if) you get an R9 JML, his granted ability does so much damage that you can win with control only. Ok, so let’s assume You have a team locked in with JML, JKL, JKR, and Hoda, and it’s up to you to put in the 5th.So, if datamining is accurate, most of these will cost $10. Which in comparison to basically everything else, is epic value in swgoh bucks. Datamining says: Starkiller: $50. Raddus: $20 (this is a 7 star hound's tooth and R5 Bossk) The other three: $10. lukenamop • 3 hr. ago.Overhead Slash.

LordDirt. 4569 posts Member. February 21, 2022 2:14AM. EP, Vader, Thrawn, Mara, and Wat can take out Rey.The only problem I have with this setup is my EP is R7 and EH is R5 omnicroned, Johanna R4, Visa Mars is R3 and StarKiller is R4 with only one zeta and one Omni and the hand gives palps so much speed the only toons rarely get a turn it's just hand palps hand hand palps I've obviously had EP and EH a lot longer then SK and I think If I add the other zetas to visa and SK I'd get better resultsJolee is a fairly popular pick. You'll see him on JML Arena teams that are climbing through GL Kenobi walls. His revive is helpful, although I'm not sure if the AI is hard-coded to focus him down (it is with GAS.) 12.

Starkiller is an Unaligned Force User who works best alongside other Force Users. An ideal squad for Starkiller contains both Light Side and Dark Side allies. To wit, his kit looks for Force Users and gets more powerful when his entire squad are ...as far as teams go, general grevious normally does well against sk, and malak does a good job of shutting down palp and mara jade tm loops. You have a decent troopers squad which might be able to pull it off if your able to get out in front, have to watch out for sk counters. I’d say go after mara -&gt; visas -&gt; palp. November 17, 2021 7:48PM. I would expect Starkiller to appear at the final tier of Solo Journeys (the ones that state a recommended GP of 2M), alongside GAS, Malak, JKL, and Executor.

Arguably, his roster he could use gba, thrawn, Vader and wat.The big 3 in the team is Captain Phasma, First Order TIE Pilot (FOTP) and Kylo Ren. FOTP has very high single target burst damage but he is hard to farm. He is an end game character. Kylo Ren is tanky and can deal massive AoE or single target damage. Captain Phasma gives advantage to all members and gives other members extra attacks.  July 5, 2023 5:58PM. Hi Holotable Heroes, Welcome to the July 2023 Road Ahead!

Palpatine, Vader, Mara Jade are necessary, Thrawn works really good here so a lot of people prefer him as the 4th and the 5th spot has A LOT of options. My favourites are BSF and Moff Gideon. Piett works really well if you don't have a troopers team yet since he can ramp Vader's damage up. Shore Trooper can be useful if you need a tank but most ...Rey, han, Chewie, jedi training Rey &amp; wat is most usable as it beats both JKR and JMLs teams.

TheTannedDwarf • 2 yr. ago.MM makes every rebel fighter assist each other. Hoth Boy has a 40% chance to give TM to whole team on his basic, so on every assist. Pao gets TM from his middle special, which is the best move to spam, so Hoth boy keeps giving TM. Kyle can grant Speed Up on his special.
