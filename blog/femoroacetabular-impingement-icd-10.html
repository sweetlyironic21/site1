Cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a known cause of groin pain and a condition that can give rise to osteoarthritis of the hip ( 1 ). Patients suffering from this condition are mainly young and experience pain when the hip is moved through internal rotation and adduction at 90° of hip flexion.A common cause of hip pain is femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). In this condition, abnormal bony morphologic features of the acetabulum or femoral head, or both, lead to abnormal joint contact and stresses with deep flexion and rotation motion. 1, 2 FAI is frequently associated with labral injury. In fact, some studies have shown that nearly all participants with labral tears have variable ...Purpose To report the prevalence of qualitative radiographic findings for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and associations among them and to characterize the inter- and intraobserver variability of these interpretations.
