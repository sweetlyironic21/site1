What kind of rock does not have rounded grains? Granite does not have rounded grains but contains interlocking grains. An example of a rock with rounded grains is a sandstone. Deltaic: Sandstone formed in deltaic environments is called deltaic sandstone. These rocks typically have a poorly sorted texture and contain a mix of sediment grain sizes, including sand, silt, and clay. The sand grains may be rounded or angular, and may contain a variety of minerals, including quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments.A poorly sorted clastic rock contains clasts that are a mixture of different sizes in its matrix. This type of clastic rock typically tells a story of sediment being transported over very short distances. Fig. 3.6.5.
