The Lower Paleozoic Era ended with the Ice Age, the temperature dropped, and a large number of species died. Later it was a period of stable weather, the weather was hot and humid, and there was a lot of carbon dioxide available in the atmosphere.The Paleozoic Era . Since most of the life in the oceans became extinct at the end of the Paleozoic Era, many new species emerged as dominant. New types of corals appeared, along with water-dwelling reptiles. Very few types of fish remained after the mass extinction, but those that did survive flourished.Paleozoic Era (542-251 Ma) Shallow Seas and Sediments. The oldest rocks exposed within the park are from the Pennsylvanian-Permian age Naco Group (319-251 Ma).
