PROBLEM 4.2. 4. Methanol, H 3 COH, is used as the fuel in some race cars. Ethanol, C 2 H 5 OH, is used extensively as motor fuel in Brazil. Both methanol and ethanol produce CO 2 and H 2 O when they burn. Write the chemical equations for these combustion reactions using Lewis structures instead of chemical formulas. Answer. A step-by-step explanation of how to draw the C2H2Cl2 Lewis Dot Structure (1,2-Dichloroethene).For the C2H2Cl2 structure use the periodic table to find the t...Final answer. To draw a Lewis structure, first add the number of outer (valence) electrons contributed by each atom to obtain the total number of outer electrons. What is this value for a molecule of C2H2 ? outer electrons.The Lewis Structure (Lewis Dot Diagram) for HCN.1. Count electrons2. Put least electronegative atom in centre3. Put one electron pair in each bond4. Fill out... </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>
