Humans subdivide time into useable units such as our calendar year, months, weeks, and days; geologists also subdivide time. They have created a tool for measuring geologic time, …Traditional stratigraphic schemes rely on two scales: (1) a time scale (using eons, eras, periods, epochs, ages, and chrons), for which each unit is defined by its beginning and ending points, and (2) a correlated scale of rock sequences (using systems, series, stages, and chronozones).One way to distinguish and define each segment of time is by the occurrence of major geologic events and the appearance (and disappearance) of significant life-forms, starting with the formation of Earth's crust followed by the appearance of ever-changing forms of life on Earth.  Geologic time, the extensive interval of time occupied by the geologic history of Earth. Formal geologic time begins with the Archean Eon (4.0 billion to 2.5 billion years ago) and continues to the present day.

The largest unit is the eon, which is further divided into smaller units such as eras, periods, and epochs. The first eon, the Hadean, lasted from the formation of the Earth until about 4 billion years ago. The eon is the largest time unit, and there are only four eons currently defined. Below the eon, lies the era -- ten eras are currently defined as an eon.Eons are divided into smaller time intervals known as eras. In the frame, the Phanerozoic is divided into three eras: Cenozoic, Mesozoic and Paleozoic.Organization. In the geologic time scale, the youngest ages are on the top and the oldest on the bottom.
