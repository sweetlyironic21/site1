The power comes out of the TIPM from fuse m27 through connector 6 pin 21 on a light blue wire with a red stripe. From there it goes into pin 5 on the ignition switch (still LB/RD).Code P0131 is a result of the oxygen sensor incorrectly detecting the air/fuel ratio of the exhaust. This ratio is sent to the ECM which uses this data, along with comparisons to the outside air, to regulate the air to fuel ratio needed by the engine. This code is the result of this ECM detecting either a voltage outside of the specified range ...2004 Twin Cam Combustion Codes. There have been reports that some production 2004 EFI Twin Cam vehicles. intermittently set codes P1353 and P1356. These vehicles were stock and had no driveability issues.

It can get "noisy" when it gets old or malfunctions and ECU cannot get a handle on the correct voltage. At idle, sensor should be reading at between about .35 to .45 volts.The ignition key turns the ignition lock cylinder. The cylinder rotation produces an analog voltage code in the Passlock™ sensor. This voltage code is received by the BCM. The BCM compares the voltage code to the previously learned voltage code. If the codes match, a class 2 message is sent from the BCM to the powertrain control module (PCM).Partial List of Harley Trouble Codes.

The B1121 and B1122 are output faults on both turn signal circuits. These can be caused by shorts to ground or when a LED or incandescent bulb fail. The B1155 is not a “neutral switch to battery short” it’s a “neutral switch short to ground”. </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup><script data-cfasync="false" src="../cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script>
