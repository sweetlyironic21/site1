Ex. Edge 1= 15ft; Edge 2= 13ft; Edge 3= 17ft; Square footage = 93.90sq. ft. Trapezoid: In this case you need the top edge, bottom edge, left side, right side.

Square or rectangle with extras. If you have an oddly shaped room, you can make the process easier by breaking a room down into smaller rectangles. Measure a nook separately from the rest of the room, for example.Step 1: Determine the Base and Height The first step in calculating the area of a triangle is to identify its base and height. The base refers to any side (length) of the triangle, while the height is the perpendicular line from that base to the opposite corner (vertex) or extending parallel from the top point touching that base at an angle. </p><br/><ul class="links"></ul></div></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>
