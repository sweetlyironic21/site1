Since its unlimited package clocks in at just $30/month, you benefit from extremely competitive prices.However, as a prepaid plan, you'll be subject to what's called 'deprioritization' with Mint Mobile, which means that T-Mobile (the network that Mint …  Deprioritization due to congestion on Mint is the exact same as on any of TMo's MVNOs. Regular data (i.e. tiered plans, unlimited plans before the threshold) is QCI 8. All deprioritized data (go, other unlimited beyond the threshold, MVNO, Visible) is all QCI 9. There isn't any distinction between the various plans other than QCI 8 and QCI 9. All QCI 8 traffic is the same and all QCI 9 traffic is the same to the network.Deprioritization affects data plan users who may have reached a specific threshold for that data plan. Thresholds aren't uniform and differ across the board. For example, T-Mobile has a plan where deprioritization begins from 50GB; once you have consumed the 50 GB then data speeds will begin to slow down, particularly when the network is congested.Depriorization will be the same on US Mobile GSM as it was on your Ultra Mobile plan.
