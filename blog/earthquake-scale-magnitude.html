A 7.8 magnitude earthquake and subsequent aftershocks killed around 9,000 people in 2015.Earthquake shaking is measured using the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) Scale. Whereas the magnitude of an earthquake describes how much energy is released by an earthquake, calculated according to the length of a fault rupture and how far it slipped, the MMI scale describes the intensity of earthquake shaking at a specific location by considering its effects on people, objects and buildings. Magnitude is the measure of the intensity of an earthquake. The Richter scale is the most well-known magnitude scale devised for an earthquake and was developed by Charles Richter at CalTech. This was the magnitude scale used historically by early seismologists. The Richter scale magnitude is determined from measurements on a seismogram. The first paper on earthquake magnitude was published by Charles F. Richter , titled An instrumental earthquake magnitude scale. Therefore, often reference is made to the size or strength of earthquakes as measured on the Richter scale. Yet, this may be incorrect, especially for large earthquakes (magnitude saturation). Richter (1935, p. 1 ...The Richter scale is a scale of numbers used to tell the power (or magnitude) of earthquakes. Charles Richter developed the Richter Scale in 1935.
