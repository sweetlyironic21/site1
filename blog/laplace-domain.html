We use a lowercase letter for the function in the time domain, and un uppercase letter in the Laplace domain.We can determine the Laplace transform of a periodic function without the need to compute any integrals. In fact, the Laplace transform of a periodic function boils down to determining the Laplace transform of another function [1, Thm. 4.25].S.Boyd EE102 Table of Laplace Transforms Rememberthatweconsiderallfunctions(signals)asdeﬂnedonlyont‚0.
