Java Statements. In Java, each statement is a complete unit of execution. For example, int score = 9*5; Here, we have a statement. The complete execution of this statement involves multiplying integers 9 and 5 and then assigning the result to the variable score.Option D: x+3 / x+1 is the only expression where the denominator will not equal zero. This is because for the denominator to equal zero, the value of x in the expression should be -1. However, if x is equal to -1, the whole expression will become undefined, and such cases are generally disregarded in mathematical problems.CLASSES AND TRENDING CHAPTER.
