Use Association arrow when two classes need to communicate and either (or both) class (es) hold reference to the second one. Association relationship is “stronger” than Dependency relationship, it implies a closer connection between entities. Example 1. Association arrow usage.The Unified Modeling Language (UML) was created to forge a common, semantically and syntactically rich visual modeling language for the architecture, design, and implementation of complex software systems both structurally and behaviorally. UML has applications beyond software development, such as process flow in manufacturing.  UML, short for Unified Modeling Language, is a standardized modeling language consisting of an integrated set of diagrams, developed to help system and software developers for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, as well as for business modeling and other non-software systems.8.New in UML2.0 Changes in activity diagram The first noticeable change is that the nodes in activity diagrams are no longer called activities.

An association almost always implies that one object has the other object as a field/property/attribute (terminology differs). A dependency typically (but not always) implies that an object accepts another object as a method parameter, instantiates, or uses another object. A dependency is very much implied by an association.ArgoUML is an open-source application that supports modeling activities using UML.
