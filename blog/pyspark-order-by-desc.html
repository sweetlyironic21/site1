The other option is to rename the column count by something different like NumReaders or whatever...  I need to order my result count tuple which is like (course, count) into descending order. I put like below. val results = ratings.countByValue () val sortedResults = results.toSeq.sortBy (_._2) But still its't working. In the above way it will sort the results by count with ascending order. But I need to have it in descending order.It is hard to say what OP means by HIVE using spark, but speaking only about Spark SQL, difference should be negligible order by stat_id desc limit 1 should use TakeOrdered... so the amount of data shuffled should be exactly the same.In sFn.expr('col0 desc'), desc is translated as an alias instead of an order by modifier, as you can see by typing it in the console: sFn.expr('col0 desc') # Column&lt;col0 AS `desc`&gt; And here are several other options you can choose from depending on …df = df.sort(col("sale").desc()) Share.
