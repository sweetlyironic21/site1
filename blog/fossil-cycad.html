Sometimes described as “living fossils,” they occur in greatly reduced numbers today, and may be close to the end of their tenure on Earth. Living cycads exist in several different habitats, such as rainforests and seasonally dry forests, in grasslands and savannas. Some grow at very high elevation. Cycads are an ancient group of vascular plants that were once a prominent component of the world’s flora.
