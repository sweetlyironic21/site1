High-Pressure Oil Leaks Happen. Just as fuel leaks can occur in conventional injection systems, the HEUI system isn’t immune to suffering an occasional leak. Typically, it’s a high-pressure oil leak you’re chasing, and it’s much more common in second-generation HEUI systems (i.e. the 6.0L Power Stroke) than on the earlier systems.Was it the steady low pressure, or unable To build pressure? Was it the oil pump you had to remove, and then just did the tubes while you where there? I know it's a lot of questions. If you want to let it die I understand. I just love learning this stuff. I am aware why you started this post and it sux you where lied to.The engine builder must repair or replace the gears in the oil pump or purchase a new pump. 7.
