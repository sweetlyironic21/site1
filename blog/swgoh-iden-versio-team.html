Try removing the cutoff (sets sort to "Seen")Hello holotable heroes! A new Imperial Trooper has arrived in the form of Iden Versio, leader of the Inferno Squad. She's from Battlefront II I think?!? Corr...  Iden Versio. Tenacious Empire Attacker who expertly takes out foes while supporting her squad. Power 35101; Speed 155; Health 36,557Contrary to what has already been said, you’ld want Range Trooper with Iden Versio if you intend on using the team for GAC, as Range gives 50% chance for attacks out of turn, which fuels Idens omikron ability. Iden works best when nobody has a leadership; and is really designed to not take away from other teams; the goal of her kit was to make use of characters like Magma who don't get much play.

For those of you going for Rey, zFinn/Poe/Holdo/VSH/VSC is also a great Geo counter (they do probably need to be relic'd, though, hence the Rey caveat). Poe needs to be faster than GBA, but other than that, it's pretty light on mod reqs - everyone else can be in the 200-230 range.Looking at Iden's kit it seemed like this could have that potential due to stacking offense and a TM train with snow trooper gaining 30% TM and other allies gaining 15% TM whenever iden dies. and another 15% TM whenever they use a special ability if shoretrooper is taunting.
