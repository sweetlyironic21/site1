RMS value is based on the heating effect of wave-forms. The value at which the heat dissipated in AC circuit is the same as the heat dissipated in DC circuit is called RMS value provided, both the AC and DC circuits have equal value of resistance and are operated at the same time.  Assume we have a periodic voltage signal V (t).By definition V (0) = V (0+T) where T is the period of the voltage signal. The average voltage takes this form: On the other hand the RMS voltage takes this form: It is easy two see that the average voltage isnt the same with the rms voltage.
