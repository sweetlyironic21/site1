For example, create the real symbolic variables a and b, and the positive symbolic variable c using sym. Figure 4b shows the real SYM-H index and the total model index (a sum of the contribution from all systems divided by 0.8). It is seen that the cross-tail current module gives ∼−35 nT contribution, and it is the main contributor to SYM - H during the main phase and early recovery (other systems give 2 times smaller contributions).For example, vpasolve (x + 1 == 2, x) numerically solves the equation x + 1 = 2 for x. By default, vpasolve finds the solutions to 32 significant digits. To change the number of significant digits, use the digits function. example.

Because f (x) is an unassigned symbolic function, it has the symbolic type "symfun". s = symType (f) s = "symfun". Assigning a mathematical expression to f (x) changes its symbolic type. f (x) = x^2; s = symType (f) s = "expression". Now check the symbolic type of f (x) = x and its derivative.The available assumptions are 'integer', 'rational', 'real', or 'positive'. You can combine multiple assumptions by specifying a string array or cell array of character vectors. For example, assume a positive rational value by specifying set as ["positive" "rational"] or {'positive','rational'} .ans = real (a) + 2 ans = real (x) - imag (y) If you assign numeric values to these variables or specify that these variables are real, real can extract the real part of the expression: syms a a = 5 + 3*i; real (a + 2) ans = 7. syms x y real real (x + y*i) ans = x. Clear the assumption that x and y are real by recreating them using syms:  SymPy uses mpmath in the background, which makes it possible to perform computations using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. That way, some special constants, like , , (Infinity), are treated as symbols and can be evaluated with arbitrary precision:The syms command is shorthand for the sym syntax, but the two functions handle assumptions differently.syms clears the assumptions when creating variables.

The symbol is used in math to represent the set of real numbers. Typically, the symbol is used in an expression like this: x ∈ R. In plain language, the expression above means that the variable x is a member of the set of real numbers.  y = gray2bin(x,modulation,M) generates a Gray-decoded output vector or matrix y with the same dimensions as its input parameter x. x can be a scalar, vector, matrix, or 3-D array. Instead, use sym with left-side output assignment, such as t = sym('t'). For more details, see Choose syms or sym Function. These variable names are invalid with syms: integer, real, rational, positive, and clear. To create symbolic scalar variables with these names, use sym.

You can also use assume and assumeAlso to set mathematical conditions on symbolic variables or expressions, such as x &gt; 2.. Alternatively, you can set assumptions when declaring …sym always treats i in character vector input as an identifier. To input the imaginary number i, use 1i instead. clear x does not clear the symbolic object of its assumptions, such as real, positive, or any assumptions set by assume, sym, or syms. To remove assumptions, use one of these options: syms clears the assumptions of the variables. These assumptions (which can be real, integer, rational, and positive) are stored separately from the symbolic object. However, recreating a variable using sym does not clear its assumptions. For more information, see Use Assumptions on Symbolic Variables.Instead, use sym with left-side output assignment, such as t = sym('t'). For more details, see Choose syms or sym Function.
